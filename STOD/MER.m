% MER(t, leafpath1, leafpath2): merge two nodes into one node
% Parameters: 1. t: root node of the tree;
%             2. leafpath1: specify t1 with its path, for example
%             o/1/2's path is [1 2];
%             3. leafpath2: specify t2 with its path, for example
%             o/1/2's path is [1 2];
% =======================================================================
% MER contains 4 subroutines which specifies its 3 stages:
%   stage 1: merge_first: compute the change to the parent of t1 or t2 (if
%   it is not lca);
%   stage 2: merge_mid: compute the change to the ancestor and non-lca of
%   t1 or t2;
%   stage 3: merge_last_case1: compute the change to the lca, when the lca
%   is the same as t2;
%   stage 3: merge_last_case2: compute the change to the lca, when the lca
%   is neither t1 nor t2;
% =======================================================================
% MER special cases:
%   case 1: t2 is the lca of t1 and t2
%   case 1.1: t2 is the parent of t1
%   case 1.2: t1's children is empty
%   case 2: neither of t1 and t2 is their lca
%   case 2.1: lca is the parent of t1 or t2 (or both)
%   case 2.2: t1's or t2's (or both's) children is empty
