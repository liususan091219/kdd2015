% merge_mid(leafpath1, leafpath1idx, p_remain, t1_pzgw, p, alpha_diff)
% Parameters: 1. leafpath1: the leafpath of node t1, which is for
%             retrieving the index path of node t1;
%             2. leafpath1idx: which position of leafpath1 we are currently
%             in;
%             3. p_remain: p(z|w) after removing the part of node t1;
%             4. t1_pzgw: p(z|w) of node t1's children;
%             5. alpha_diff: node t1's alpha0, which is saved to be subtracted by
%          its grand parents's alpha0's
% Outputs: 1. leafpath1idx: updated leafpath1idx;
%          2. p_remain: updated p_remain;
%          3. t1_pzgw: updated t1_pzgw;
% =======================================================================
% Computation steps:
% 1. compute p(z|w) for z = 1,2,...,k, w=1,2,...,V for current node p;
% 2. update p_remain, which is the remaining p(z|w) for children of current
%  node p: if the child z is on the path from node t1 to p, p'(z|p,w) =
%  p(z|p,w)- prod_{z' on the original path from t1 to p} p(z'|parent(z'), w);
%  otherwise, don't change p(z|w).  e.g., if node t1's parent is t3 and
%  grandparent is t4, then after merging p'(z_{t3}|z_{t4},w) =
% p(z_{t3}|z_{t4}, w) - p(z_{t1}|z_{t3}, w)p(z_{t3}|z_{t4},w).
% 3. normalize p'(z|w) for each w, such that all z's sum up to 1.
% 4. apply Bayesian rule p'(z|w)p(w) = p'(w|z)p'(z) to children of p, 
% compute p'(w|z) following p'(w|z) prop to p'(z|w)p(w); and
% p'(z)=sum_{w}p(z|w)p(w), where p(w) is computed previously in MER;
